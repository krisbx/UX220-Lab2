    <h1> Favourite thing I have read.</h1>
    <p>This is Water by David Foster Wallace. This speech was written to conceptualize the way you perceive experiences in your life. His ability to articulate human experiences through simple scenarios turns an incredibly difficult idea into a brilliant piece of writing.
        He describes how our everyday tasks and routines leave us in a repetitive and self-centered mindset, where we feel every inconvenience is targeted at us. He dives into the boring aspects of adult life: whether it be your 3-hour-long project not saving, the guy who just cut you off during rush hour, or the line that's just <i>too</i> long at the store, your mind will always fall back to "why me?"
           Wallace goes on to explain how by simply shifting our view on life, we no longer see the car cutting us off as an act of anger, but instead a father-to-be rushing his wife to the hospital. No longer does the cashier messing up your price anger you, but instead has you thinking, "She could be exhausted, standing for hours with constant interaction."
           Wallace's essay highlights important philosophical ideas and stands as an important reminder that life is not always about YOU, but what you can turn it into.</p>
