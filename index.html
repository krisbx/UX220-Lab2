    <h1> Favourite thing I have read.</h1>
    <p>This is Water by David Foster Wallace. This speech was written to short of shed light on how you perceive the meaning of experiences in your life.
    His ability to articulate human experiences is what makes his writing stand out. He describes how our everyday tasks and routines leave us in a repetitive and self-centered mindset, where we feel every inconvenience is targeted at us.
    Wallace goes on to explain how by simply shifting our view on life, we no longer see the car cutting us off as an act of anger, but instead a father-to-be rushing his wife to the hospital.
    His essay stands out for its philosophical ideas, long-lasting guidance, and an important reminder that life is not always about YOU, but what you can turn it into.</p>
